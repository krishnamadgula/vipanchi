I'm trying to experiment synthesizing carnatic music my own way.

First iteration is to produce random music in a given raagam and a taalam:

- Raagam - composed of Swara Sthanas, Aarohanam and Avarohanam. Need to handle Gamakas.
- Taalam - composed of laghu, dhritam and anudhrutam - represents the cycle or beat.
- Choose an Instrument - the output must vary based on the instrument - use overtones with varying frequencies.
